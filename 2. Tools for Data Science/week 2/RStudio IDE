RStudio IDE is one of the open source web-based tools in Data Scientist Workbench.
It allows you to analyze data, take advantage of many statistical packages and create beautiful visualizations and web applications. 
As its name suggests, RStudio IDE is only for R. Like other IDEs, in RStudio IDE, you can code in a console or script editor,
keep track of your variables and history, display your plots, manage your packages and see help documentation for R. If you're an R user,
you'll already be familiar with this type of setup, where you can analyze data, see your console and visualize your plots and 
graphs all in the same environment. Another great feature is that you'll also have access to Apache Spark. By simply typing SC 
from the editor or console and running it, you'll see that you can run Spark R code to analyze big data. Taking it a step further, 
R also gives you access to a Shiny library, which you can use to make your visualizations interactive. 
Using Shiny, you can create all sorts of web-based interactive apps just using R code.
To open RStudio IDE, simply click the RStudio IDE button on the Data Scientist Workbench home page.
