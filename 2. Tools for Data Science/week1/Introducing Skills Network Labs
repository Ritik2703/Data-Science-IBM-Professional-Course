This week, you will get an overview of the various data science tools available to you, 
hosted on the IBM Developer Skills Network Labs (SN Labs). 
You will create an account and start exploring some of the features.

Skills Network Labs is an environment that contains tools such as RStudio, 
Jupyter Notebook, and Zeppelin Notebook. These tools provides an interactive 
environment for you to perform data analysis, data visualization, machine 
learning and image recognition. For example, on Jupyter Notebook you can 
train a model that can recognize the denomination of an Euro banknote by using just the image of the banknote.
